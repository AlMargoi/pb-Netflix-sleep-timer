## Description
I always used to fall asleep watching movies or series, only to be woken up by noises when the sleep is the sweetest. 
Well, not anymore. This script allows you to set a sleep timer, time after which the script will click the screen, pausing your Netflix. 
It also provides the option to shutdown the PC either once with the sleep timer, or with a customised delay.

## How to use
Just right click the PS1 file and "Run with Powershell". 
You will be asked 3 questions:
1. How long do you want the sleep timer configured for? - after this time, the movie will be paused
2. Do you want to shutdown the PC after that time? - if YES, then the PC will be shut down
3. How many minutes to wait before shutdown? - this is if you want an additional delay between pausing the video and the shutdown. This is useful in case the video is paused before you fall asleep and you want to reconfigure it. You need to press CTRL + C to exit current run, and then re-run it.
